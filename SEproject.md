### **Problem Statement: Transforming College Event Transactions for Maximum Engagement and Modern Appeal**

**Background:**
At our college events, students often hesitate to spend money on games and activities due to the psychological weight of using real cash or UPI. This hesitation limits their engagement, slows down transactions, and ultimately dampens the excitement and energy of the event.

**The Challenge:**
How can we eliminate this spending hesitation and create a more engaging, modern, and seamless transaction experience that enhances student participation and excitement at our college events?

**Proposed Solution:**
We propose introducing a **5X Event Points System** that converts students' money into event-specific points at a rate of five times the cash value, creating a modern and exciting way to spend at events.

**Key Features:**
- **Increased Spending Freedom:** Students convert their money into points at a **5X rate**, making each point feel less valuable and encouraging more spontaneous spending.
- **Streamlined Transactions:** Payments are made only once—during top-up or redemption—freeing students from the burden of multiple transactions.
- **Seamless Experience:** At each stall, students simply **scan a QR code or select a game** to receive a digital token, which acts as a ticket for the activity.
- **Transparency and Trust:** After playing, the stall owner invalidates the token, with the status clearly visible to both parties, ensuring transparency.

**Benefits:**
- **Maximized Engagement:** The **5X Points System** reduces spending hesitation, resulting in more active participation and a lively event atmosphere.
- **Modern and Efficient:** The virtual points, QR codes, and digital tokens offer a sleek, tech-savvy experience that resonates with today’s students.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** With a single payment process and transparent token validation, students enjoy a smooth, hassle-free event experience.

This innovative system not only addresses the current barriers to participation but also sets a new standard for how we conduct transactions at our events. It’s time to modernize, engage, and create memorable experiences that resonate with every student. With your support, we can make our college events more dynamic and exciting than ever before.
