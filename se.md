**Title:** Seamless Event Engagement: Streamlining Transactions and Stall Discovery

**Introduction:**
- Problem: Students hesitate to spend money at college events, which reduces participation and overall excitement.
- Solution: Implement a points-based transaction system and easy stall discovery to boost engagement.

**How It Works:**
1. **Points System:** 
   - Students convert money into virtual points.
   - Points are used for all event transactions, making spending feel less significant.

2. **Streamlined Transactions:**
   - Payments are made only once during top-up or redemption.
   - At stalls, students scan a QR code or select a game to receive a digital token.
   - Stall owners invalidate tokens after use, ensuring transparency.

3. **Stall Discovery:**
   - Students can easily search for stalls and games using a digital platform.
   - Information on each stall, including location and offerings, is readily accessible.

**Benefits:**
- **Increased Participation:** Easier spending encourages more student involvement.
- **Efficiency:** Quick, single-point payments and easy stall discovery streamline the event experience.
- **Modern Appeal:** The system creates a tech-savvy, engaging environment.

**Conclusion:**
- This approach will energize college events, making them more dynamic and enjoyable for everyone.
